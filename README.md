# Liz Hare, PhD
## Dog Genetics LLC

I have two main areas of interest:
* working dog genetic, genomic, behavior and health research and breeding program analysis
* inclusion and accessibility in the R and open science communities

You can learn more about my dog-related work, including a publication list, on [my CV](https://lizharedogs.github.io/hare_cv/).

*Accessibility note: I provide links to both videos and slides for most talks.
It's important to provide access to slides in advance because screen readers can't provide access to video content like screen sharing on Zoom or YouTube videos.
If you find accessibility problems with anything here, please let me know at <lizhare@gmail.com>.*


## Working Dogs

### [ManyDogs Project](https://lizharedogs.github.io/hare_cv/), Assistant Director for Data Management and Open Science

ManyDogs is a big team science project aimed at enhancing our understanding of dog cognition by conducting standardized experiments at many sites using open science principles.
The consortium will be able to address the problem of small sample sizes often found in this field.

* [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/9r5xf/)


### [PennVet Working Dog Center](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers-laboratories/center/penn-vet-working-dog-center), Contract Researcher


The PennVet Working Dog Center does research on a wide variety of health and behavior topics related to dogs in training for careers like search and rescue and odor detection.
I've worked with them over about ten years to identify statistical methods for their research questions, and to manage and analyze data.  


I presented these slides from the [2021 IWDBA conference](https://lizharedogs.github.io/iwdba2021/#2) on the agreement between dogs' fosters and trainers on behavior questionnaires.
If you are a member of the organization, you can see the video on the [IWDA website](https://www.iwdba.org).

## Inclusion and Accessibility

I also work on inclusion and accessibility in the R and open science communities.

### UseR! 2021. Organizing Committee

I worked with a great team to organize [UseR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/accessibility/#:~:text=Accessibility%20at%20useR!,ways%20we%20work%20and%20meet.).
The website is a great resource for those hoping to plan inclusive conferences. Here are some related resources;  

* [We wrote a paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010164) sharing what we learned from each other and our experience.  

* Some of the team members built a [Knowledgebase](https://gitlab.com/rconf/userknowledgebase) after the event as a guide for future events.

* My colleagues [interviewed me](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=youtube+liz+hare+2021+accessibility&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#fpstate=I've&vld=cid:c9afd21d,vid:B_ZmcYoDmhU) about my perspective as a screen reader user.

### [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html), Co-Lead, Accessibility Working Group and Book Dash Participant

[Andrea Sánchez-Tapia](https://github.com/AndreaSanchezTapia) and I gave a talk on Accessibility and Data Science for the November 2022 Book Dash.

### [RSE-AU/NZ](https://github.com/rse-aunz), Accessibility Consulting

I provided an [accessibility evaluation report and suggestions for the future](https://github.com/rse-aunz/rse-aunz.github.io/blob/master/RSEAUNZAccessibility.Rmd) for the 2022 Unconference.

I consulted with the Australia-New Zealand Research Software Engineering Unconference organizers in 2022 to evaluate the accessibility of the event and make suggestions for future events.  


### Alt Text

Alternative ("Alt") text is a critical accessibility practice.
It is written text that describes image contents and meaning.
It's especially important for scientists who need access to information provided in graphical forms.

#### Alt Text in Paleontology

I gave a workshop on writing alt text to [Time Scavengers](https://timescavengers.blog/about-us/project-overview-2/) science communication students.
The video is no longer available but the [Time Scavengers Workshop Slides are](https://lizharedogs.github.io/TimeScavengersWorkshopAltText/#8).
We talked about a wide variety of scientific images including photos and diagrams in addition to my usual focus on data visualizations.

#### Alt Text in Data Visualization

The [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org) produced a book about accessibility practices for data visualization, [Do No Harm: Centering Accessibility in Data Visualization](https://www.urban.org). I wrote Chapter 4, "Writing Alt Text to Communicate the Meaning in Data Visualizations," introducing two models to think about how to write complete alt texts for graphs.

I gave a talk to [R-Ladies NYC](https://www.rladiesnyc.org) on "Writing Meaningful Alt Text for Data Visualizations in R." [You can watch the Alt Text in R video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXV5bx1WQTM) or read the [Alt Text in R Slides](https://lizharedogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText/#1).
The topics include writing complete alt texts and how to include them in R Markdown outputs like HTML reports and Xaringan slides.   

[Silvia Canelón](https://github.com/spcanelon) and I investigated the use of alt text in the #TidyTuesday R data visualization learning group at [CSVconf](https://csvconf.com) in 2021.
